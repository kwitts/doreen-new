      <p>
      Growing	up	being	the	middle	daughter	with one	older	sister	and	one	younger sister I	soon	began	to	be envious	of	their	straight hair,	feeling	frustrated	with	my	unruly	curls	and	frizz. I felt	unaccepted,	less-than and	ugly. If	you	have	ever	felt	those	feelings, you	are	not	alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        I	found	Deva	Curl	over	5	years	ago	and	realized	curly	and	unruly	hair	was	soon	to	become	my	passion, I have	lived	with	curly,	unruly	hair	and	have	now	created	a	passion for curly hair. My	passion for	the	last five	years	has	been	to	become a	curly	haired	Deva	Curl	expert, which	I	have accomplished through ongoing	education,	investing	time, finances and	the	willingness to	commit	to	those	standards. Investing	in	myself to	bring	fresh,	current, precise	techniques	in order t	to	give	you	the	best	for	your investment	of	time	and	money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why	make	an	appointment	with	me,	when there	are	so	many	other stylists doing	Deva	Curl? Because of	my	passion,	my	driving	force	and	standards, I	will	help	you	fall	in	love	over and	over	with	your	curly hair.	I	live	curly every day.
